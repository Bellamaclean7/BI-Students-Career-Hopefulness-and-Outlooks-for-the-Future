# BI-Students-Career-Hopefulness-and-Outlooks-for-the-Future

This dataset was created as part of an assignment requirement for the course INF412HI: Data Analytics. The creation of a datasheet was in no way part of the assignment requirements for INF412H1: Data Analytics and will not be used as part of any assessment other than INF312H1: Worlds Become Data - Tutorial 11. It was of personal interest to use this dataset to complete Tutorial 11 to gain experience creating a datasheet for a dataset I created/own.

This dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of survey responses gathered from students enrolled in the Bachelor of Information (BI) program at the University of Toronto. The survey, conducted in March 2024, aimed to capture a wide array of perspectives regarding students' career aspirations, their expectations about post-graduation employment, and their perceptions of how well the BI program prepares them for future careers in the information sector. The survey was created by the research team, Bella Maclean, Marcin Jaczynski, Finn Karol, and Sofia Sellitto using Google Forms. The dataset is intended for use by researchers and faculty members interested in exploring academic program outcomes, student career preparedness, and the alignment between the BI program and students' level of satisfaction related to career hopefulness.
